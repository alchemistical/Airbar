# Sprint Planning & Development Workflow

## üèÅ IMMEDIATE KICKOFF ACTIONS (Today)

### Step 1: Environment Setup Validation
```bash
# Verify your development environment

# Check all services together
pnpm dev  # Should start all services
```

### Step 2: Create Feature Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to Sprint 1 feature branch
git checkout -b feature/sprint-1-unified-dashboard
git push -u origin feature/sprint-1-unified-dashboard
```

### Step 3: Setup Development Tracking
Create these tracking files in your repo:

```bash
# Create Sprint 1 tracking file
touch docs/sprints/sprint-1-progress.md
```

## üî• CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### Technical Excellence:
1. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before or alongside implementation
2. **Code Reviews**: Self-review before committing, team review for major changes
3. **Performance First**: Monitor API response times and bundle sizes continuously
4. **Mobile First**: Test on mobile devices throughout development

### Project Management:
1. **Daily Progress Updates**: Keep tracking file updated daily
2. **Dependency Management**: Don't start tasks until dependencies complete
3. **Risk Identification**: Flag blockers immediately, don't wait
4. **Scope Protection**: Stay focused on Sprint 1 goals, resist feature creep

### Quality Gates:
- **Code Quality**: ESLint passes, TypeScript compiles without errors
- **Testing**: 80%+ test coverage for new code
- **Performance**: API < 200ms, Frontend < 2s load time
- **Accessibility**: WCAG AA compliance for dashboard components

## üéØ NEXT SPRINT TRANSITION

### Sprint 1 ‚Üí Sprint 2 Handoff:

**Completion Requirements**:
- All Sprint 1 tasks completed and tested
- Feature branch merged to main
- Staging deployment successful  
- Performance benchmarks achieved
- User feedback collected from internal testing

**Sprint 2 Preparation**:
- Smart matching algorithm research completed
- ML pipeline architecture designed
- Test datasets prepared for algorithm training
- Sprint 2 feature branch created

### Retrospective Questions:
1. What worked well in Sprint 1?
2. What slowed us down or caused issues?
3. What would we do differently in Sprint 2?
4. Are our time estimates accurate for similar tasks?
5. Do we have the right tools and processes?

This workflow document provides the structure needed to execute Sprint 1 successfully. Each team member should bookmark this and refer to it daily for consistent execution and progress tracking.
