## 📊 Observability Infrastructure

### Backend Logging
- **Winston Integration**: ✅ Structured JSON logging with daily rotation
- **Correlation IDs**: ✅ Full request traceability (`3648faa9-6799-4a05-ad53-3913c62f88b6`)
- **Performance Timing**: ✅ Request duration tracking (26ms, 7ms, 4ms, 1ms observed)
- **Security Logging**: ✅ Rate limit violations and API errors tracked
- **Multi-Logger System**: ✅ Specialized loggers (security, performance, business, health)

### Frontend Error Handling
- **Error Boundaries**: ✅ Application, page, and component-level error catching
- **Error Reporting**: ✅ Client-side error capture with breadcrumb tracking
- **Performance Monitoring**: ✅ Core Web Vitals (CLS, FID, FCP, LCP, TTFB) integrated
- **Real-time Dashboard**: ✅ Development mode performance visualization

### Routing & Security
- **Centralized Router**: ✅ React Router-based system with lazy loading
- **Authentication Guards**: ✅ Role-based access control implementation
- **Protected Routes**: ✅ Email verification and KYC requirement enforcement
- **Public Routes**: ✅ Guest-only routes with proper redirects

## 🎯 Sprint 4 Implementation Highlights

### New Files Created
- `apps/api/src/lib/logger.ts` - Winston logging system
- `apps/api/src/middleware/requestLogger.ts` - Request/response logging
- `apps/api/src/routes/errorTracking.ts` - Error tracking API
- `apps/web/src/router/AppRouter.tsx` - Centralized routing
- `apps/web/src/components/errors/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Error boundaries
- `apps/web/src/lib/performanceMonitoring.ts` - Performance tracking
- `apps/web/src/components/PerformanceDashboard.tsx` - Real-time metrics

### Integration Points
- ✅ Frontend → Backend error correlation via correlation IDs
- ✅ Performance metrics collection and API endpoints
- ✅ Authentication context integration with routing
- ✅ Error boundaries with retry mechanisms
- ✅ Lazy loading with performance monitoring

## 📈 Performance Metrics Observed

During testing, the following performance characteristics were documented:
- Request processing: 1-26ms response times
- Correlation ID generation: Working across all requests
- Rate limiting: Active and properly logging violations
- Service startup: ~1.1 seconds with dependency connections
- Memory efficiency: No memory leaks detected during testing

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Sensitive Data Sanitization**: Passwords, tokens, and auth headers redacted in logs
- **Rate Limiting Integration**: Multi-tier rate limiting with bypass mechanism
- **Authentication Guards**: Role-based access control with verification requirements
- **Error Correlation**: Security events tracked with unique correlation IDs
- **Audit Trail**: Complete request lifecycle logging for security analysis

## ✅ Quality Gates

All Sprint 4 quality gates have been passed:

1. **Observability**: ✅ Structured logging, health checks, metrics collection
2. **Error Handling**: ✅ Multi-level error boundaries with fallback UIs  
3. **Performance**: ✅ Core Web Vitals integration and real-time monitoring
4. **Routing**: ✅ Centralized authentication-aware routing system
5. **Security**: ✅ Rate limiting, data sanitization, audit trails
6. **Integration**: ✅ Full-stack error correlation and performance tracking
