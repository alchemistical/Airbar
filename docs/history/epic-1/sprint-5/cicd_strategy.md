### Workflow Categories

#### 1. **Continuous Integration** (`ci-enhanced.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to `main`, `develop`, PRs to `main`
**Purpose:** Code quality, security, and build validation
**Duration:** ~8-12 minutes

**Stages:**
- **Hygiene Gate** (2-3 min): Lint, format, type-check, deadcode analysis
- **Security Gate** (3-4 min): Vulnerability scanning, secrets detection, SAST
- **Build Gate** (2-3 min): Multi-package build validation, dependency checks
- **Test Gate** (3-4 min): Unit tests, coverage reporting, test quality metrics

#### 2. **Security Scanning** (`security-scan.yml`)
**Triggers:** Daily schedule, security-related file changes
**Purpose:** Comprehensive security assessment
**Duration:** ~15-20 minutes

**Scans:**
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** SNYK, npm audit, GitHub Advisory
- **Container Security:** Trivy, Docker security scanning
- **Code Security:** SAST with CodeQL, secret scanning
- **License Compliance:** FOSSA or license-checker integration

#### 3. **Deployment Pipeline** (`deploy-staging.yml`, `deploy-production.yml`)
**Triggers:** 
- Staging: Push to `develop`, successful CI
- Production: Tag creation, manual approval
**Purpose:** Multi-environment deployment automation

**Environments:**
- **Staging:** Automatic deployment for `develop` branch
- **Production:** Tag-based deployment with manual approval gates

#### 4. **Release Management** (`release.yml`)
**Triggers:** Manual workflow dispatch, tag creation
**Purpose:** Automated versioning, changelog, and release creation
