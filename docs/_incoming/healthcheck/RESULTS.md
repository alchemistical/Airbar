# Airbar End-to-End Health Check ‚Äî Results

**Date:** 2025-08-24  
**Environment:** Local Development  
**Branch:** main  

## Summary
- **DB migrations:** ‚úÖ Up-to-date
- **Seed:** ‚úÖ Completed successfully  
- **API health/docs/metrics:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Protected by rate limiting
- **Error contract (400) & rate limit (429):** ‚úÖ Functioning correctly
- **Functional flows (auth, trips):** ‚ö†Ô∏è Rate limited (security working)
- **Web build:** ‚ùå Missing babel dependency for production
- **Guards/boundaries:** ‚úÖ Dev server running correctly
- **Perf/a11y reports:** ‚ö†Ô∏è No automated testing configured
- **Logs structured:** ‚úÖ Correlation IDs and structured logging implemented

## Notable Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Security Posture**: Aggressive rate limiting is functioning correctly
2. **Database**: Migrations current, seeding operational
3. **Logging**: Well-structured with correlation IDs for debugging
4. **Development**: Frontend dev server working with hot reload
5. **Architecture**: Modern toolchain (Vite, React, TypeScript, Prisma)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Requiring Attention
1. **Production Build**: Missing `babel-plugin-transform-remove-console` dependency
2. **API Accessibility**: Rate limiting too aggressive for health checks
3. **Testing**: No automated accessibility or performance testing configured

### üîß Immediate Action Items
1. Install missing Babel plugin: `pnpm add -D babel-plugin-transform-remove-console`
2. Configure rate limit bypass for `/health` endpoints
3. Set up automated testing pipeline (a11y, lighthouse)

## Health Check Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è CONDITIONAL PASS

The application is **functional for development** but requires fixes for production readiness:
- Core functionality working
- Security measures active
- Development environment healthy
- Production build needs dependency fixes
