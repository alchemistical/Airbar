# API Route Analysis

## Observed Behavior:
- API running on port 3001
- Rate limiting: 429 responses on /api/health, /api/docs
- Root endpoint (/): 404 (expected, no root handler)
- Health endpoint (/health): 404 (may be at different path)

## Rate Limiting Status:
✅ Rate limiting active and functioning (good security)
⚠️ Unable to access endpoints due to aggressive rate limiting

## Recommendation:
Rate limiting should be bypassed for health checks in production
