# Performance & Accessibility Assessment

## Frontend Performance
✅ Dev server responds quickly (< 1s)
✅ Vite hot reload optimized for development
✅ Modern build tooling (Vite + React)

## Accessibility Notes
- No automated a11y testing configured
- Manual review needed for WCAG compliance
- Component library (Radix UI) suggests good a11y foundation

## Recommendations
1. Install and configure @axe-core/playwright for automated a11y testing
2. Add lighthouse CI for performance monitoring
3. Configure performance budgets in build process

## Status
⚠️ No automated testing configured
✅ Good foundation with modern tooling
