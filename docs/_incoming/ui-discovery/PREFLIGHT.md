# UI Discovery â€“ Preflight

**Date**: 2025-08-24  
**Objective**: Discover intended UI/dashboard structure and real routing setup

## Status
- Current App.tsx: Simple status page ("Monorepo migration successful!")
- User expects: Access to homepage, dashboard, flows, pages
- Issue: Routing infrastructure unclear, components may exist but not connected

## Discovery Plan
1. Router & pages inventory
2. Build route map from static analysis  
3. Find working versions from git history
4. Map page/component locations
5. Propose routing plan
6. Validate build status

**Next**: Router entry points and page component search
