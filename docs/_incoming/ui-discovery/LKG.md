# Last Known Good (LKG) Analysis

## Summary
The last working router setup was found in commit **6eed84b** (2025-08-24).

## Key Findings

### Working Router Structure (6eed84b)
- **Router Library**: Wouter
- **Structure**: Simple 5-route setup with navigation
- **Status**: Functional with navigation header and landing page

### Core Components Status
1. **Dashboard.tsx** 
   - Status: ✅ Feature-complete
   - Dependencies: DashboardLayout, UI components, @tanstack/react-query
   - Last meaningful change: 821f68d (docs reorganization)

2. **marketing/HomePage.tsx**
   - Status: ✅ Feature-complete marketing page
   - Dependencies: Multiple marketing components (Header, Footer, HeroIntent, etc.)
   - Last meaningful change: a3593f8 (2025-07-16 - landing page revamp)

3. **AddTrip.tsx & SendPackage.tsx**
   - Status: ✅ Exist and appear functional
   - Purpose: Core user flows for trip/package creation

### Critical Insight
The original app had a **progressive disclosure** approach:
1. **Marketing Homepage** (`/`) - Full marketing site
2. **Quick Start Landing** (`/landing`) - Simple onboarding with cards
3. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Full featured dashboard 
4. **Core Actions** (`/add-trip`, `/send-package`) - Key user flows

## Regression Analysis

### What Broke
1. **Current State**: Simple status page (no routing)
2. **Previous State**: Working 5-route app with navigation
3. **Gap**: 45+ additional page components exist but never connected

### Root Cause
The app was simplified to a status page during monorepo migration, but the complex page components and infrastructure remained intact, creating a disconnect between:
- **Simple current state** (status page)
- **Complex available components** (50 page files)
- **User expectations** (full dashboard/homepage access)

## Recommendation
Restore the **6eed84b** router structure as baseline, then progressively add routes for the 45+ additional components that exist.
