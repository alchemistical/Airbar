# Tailwind Build Log

## Before Fix:
- Content paths: ["./client/index.html", "./client/src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"]  
- Status: ❌ No files found (wrong directory)
- Result: No CSS classes generated, unstyled UI

## After Fix:
- Content paths: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mdx}", "../../packages/shared/src/**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx,mdx}"]
- Status: ✅ Files found and scanned
- Result: Full Tailwind CSS build with all utility classes

## Dev Server Restart:
- Vite restarted successfully
- Tailwind CSS rebuild triggered  
- Hot reload active for style changes
