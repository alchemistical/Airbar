🧠 PROJECT: Build the full UI/UX for the “Tracking” section of Airbar’s dashboard

📍 ROUTE: `/tracking`

🎯 GOAL:
Enable both travelers and parcel senders to track the live status and timeline of confirmed parcel deliveries — from match to final delivery — in a clear, intuitive, and responsive interface.

🧭 USER FLOW OVERVIEW:

View (filtered by role):
- Travelers: Track all accepted parcels on their upcoming/current trips.
- Senders: Track the parcels they’ve submitted that are matched and in delivery.

States to track:
1. Confirmed
2. Picked Up
3. In Transit
4. Delivered
5. Cancelled / Reported Issue

📦 COMPONENTS REQUIRED:

1. **Tracking Overview Panel (List View)**
   - Match ID
   - Parcel Title
   - Sender/Traveler name with profile tag
   - Origin → Destination
   - Delivery Deadline
   - Current Status Badge
   - Last Updated Timestamp
   - Action Button: “View Timeline” / “Details”

2. **Parcel Tracking Timeline (Details View)**
   - Full-page or modal
   - Horizontal progress bar with states: Confirmed → Picked Up → In Transit → Delivered
   - Visual status indicator with timestamp for each step
   - Expandable for:
     • Pickup & Delivery Address
     • Weight, Dimensions
     • Traveler Details
     • Reward
     • Chat (Open Channel)

3. **Map Integration (optional enhancement)**
   - Embedded route visualization (based on cities)
   - Highlight current parcel location if data available

4. **Action Buttons (Conditional per Role & Status)**
   - Traveler: Mark as Picked Up / In Transit / Delivered
   - Sender: Report Issue / Open Chat / View Status

5. **Filters & Sorting**
   - Status: All, In Progress, Delivered, Reported
   - Sort by: Newest, Delivery Deadline, Status
   - Search Bar: Match ID, User Name, City

🧩 ROLE-BASED LOGIC:
- Must route differently for /dashboard/traveler and /dashboard/sender
- Only users involved in the match can track a parcel
- Add a visual flag for delays or issues

🎨 DESIGN STANDARDS:
- Match Airbar's current UI style (colors, typography, buttons)
- Sidebar must be present
- Use the same card style as “Matches” section
- Timeline component should be intuitive and clean
- Must be responsive for mobile and desktop views

🧪 TEST CASES:
- Update transitions (Pick up → Transit → Delivered)
- Timeline reflects accurate timestamps
- Issue reporting triggers confirmation
- Cross-role access (sender and traveler) works as expected
