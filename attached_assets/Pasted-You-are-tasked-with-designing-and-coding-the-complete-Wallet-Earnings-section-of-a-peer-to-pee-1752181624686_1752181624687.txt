You are tasked with designing and coding the complete **Wallet (Earnings)** section of a peer-to-peer logistics platform called Airbar, built for desktop-first responsive web use.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
Create a modern, modular, and scalable UI/UX for the **Wallet section**, where users manage their delivery earnings, referral bonuses, escrowed funds, withdrawal requests, and transaction history.

Design should follow the **Airbar design system** (clean layout, white background, soft shadows, icon-driven navigation, modular cards, TailwindCSS-style utility classes). Left sidebar must remain consistent with the main app navigation structure.

- Use mock user data for transactions, referrals, escrow state, and bonuses

- React + TailwindCSS (preferred)
- Modular component structure
- Dummy API functions to simulate state changes

ðŸŽ¯ Final Deliverable:
A fully functional Wallet UI section with all pages and components above, adhering to the design standards, data flows, and structure outlined. Build navigation logic using browser router or conditional tabs.
