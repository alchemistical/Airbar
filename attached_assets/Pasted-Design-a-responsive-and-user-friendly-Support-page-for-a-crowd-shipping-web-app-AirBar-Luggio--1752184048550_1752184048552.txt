Design a responsive and user-friendly **Support page** for a crowd-shipping web app (AirBar/Luggio) using Tailwind CSS and React (or Next.js if preferred).

🧭 OBJECTIVE:
Create a modular and helpful Support Center that provides users with:
1. Quick access to help resources
2. A direct way to contact support
3. A self-service FAQ/knowledge base

👤 ROLES:
Both Travelers and Senders will use this page. Show role-neutral language unless a specific case applies.

📐 LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
Use a clean 2-column layout:
- Left side: navigation (for support topics)
- Right side: content display

---

🧩 MAIN COMPONENTS:

1. 🆘 Support Overview Header
- Title: “Help & Support”
- Subtitle: “Find answers or reach out to our support team”
- Include search bar to filter articles or issues
- Show Contact Support button

2. 🔍 Search & Browse
- Search input with typeahead support (simulate logic for now)
- Filter dropdown: Traveler issues, Sender issues, Payments, Technical, Account, Escrow, Ratings, etc.

3. 📚 FAQ / Knowledge Base (Cards or Accordion Style)
- Sample Questions:
  - How does matching work?
  - When do I get paid?
  - What if my parcel is lost?
  - How do I report a traveler/sender?
  - What is Escrow and how does it work?
  - How can I cancel a trip or request?

4. 💬 Contact Support Section
- Options:
  - Live Chat (inactive placeholder or “Coming soon”)
  - Submit a Ticket (form with category, subject, message, file upload)
  - Email: support@airbar.app (click to open mail)

5. 🧾 My Requests (Mini Dashboard)
- Table-style component showing user’s previous support tickets:
  - Ticket ID
  - Subject
  - Status (Open, Resolved, Pending Reply)
  - Last Updated
  - CTA: View Details

---

🎨 DESIGN LANGUAGE:
- Match AirBar’s clean and soft interface
- Use soft blues and greys for trust/support vibes
- Tailwind layout with padding-6, rounded-xl, soft shadows
- Collapsible sections for FAQs
- Responsive layout with full mobile support

---

📲 INTERACTIONS:
- Clicking a FAQ expands it inline (accordion)
- "Contact Support" opens a modal or directs to a form section
- “My Requests” table allows sorting and filtering by status/date

🧪 TECH IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Simulate ticket backend with dummy state
- Search/FAQ can be dummy-filtered for now
- Use reusable card components for FAQ, Tickets, and Submit Form
