You are designing the "Parcel Requests" module for a web-based crowdshipping app called Airbar. The goal is to connect **travelers** and **parcel senders** through a trusted platform. This prompt focuses on building the full UI/UX for the Parcel Requests feature, aligned with the project‚Äôs style guide and standard web layout.

üí° General Guidelines:
- Web app design in **desktop format (1440px width)**
- Use a **2-column layout** with a left sidebar and right main content
- Consistent layout with existing dashboard style
- Sidebar is always visible
- Responsive, professional UI for a logistics platform
- Match navigation and flows to actual user journeys
- Avoid hallucinations, stick to provided data and flows

üéØ USER ROLES:
- Traveler (receives parcel requests, accepts/declines them)
- Sender (creates parcel requests, tracks status)
