Replit Prompt: Build “Trips” Section UI/UX for Airbar Web App
You are designing the “Trips” section of Airbar, a web-based peer-to-peer crowdshipping platform that connects parcel senders with travelers who have unused luggage space. This interface is for Travelers to manage and publish trips via the dashboard.

Form Elements: Clean input fields, icons for date/time, dropdowns for parcel types


Cards: Rounded, elevation for individual trips
