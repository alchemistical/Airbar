Design a modern, responsive web dashboard for a peer-to-peer delivery platform (AirBar/Luggio) using Tailwind CSS and React (or Next.js if needed). This dashboard should serve as the central hub for both **travelers** and **senders**, displaying personalized info, KPIs, and actionable items.

👥 ROLE-BASED RENDERING:
- If the logged-in user is a **Traveler**, show Parcel Requests and Upcoming Trips.
- If the user is a **Sender**, show Active Matches and Tracking Info.
- Show default dashboard with core info if no role is set yet.

📐 LAYOUT STRUCTURE:
- Use a 2-column layout:
  - Left Sidebar (collapsed option)
  - Main dashboard view with grid-based content cards

🎯 TOP HEADER STATS (4 tiles, dynamic by role):
- Active Trips (or Deliveries in Progress)
- Parcel Requests (or Matches Pending)
- In Escrow Amount (💸 for traveler only)
- Average Rating (link to Reviews)

💡 QUICK ACTIONS WIDGET:
Add a horizontally scrollable "Quick Actions" row or buttons:
- ➕ Add Trip
- 📦 Create Parcel Request
- 🧾 Track a Parcel
- 💰 Withdraw Funds
- 🏷 Invite Friends

📊 WALLET SNAPSHOT OR GRAPH:
Replace the current unclear earnings graph with:
- “Available Balance”
- “Pending Earnings”
- “Total Earned”
- Show “Withdraw” CTA and link to Wallet page
- Optional: toggle between Line Graph and Summary Stats

📋 TO-DO LIST WIDGET:
A personalized action list showing:
- Unaccepted Matches
- Pending Delivery Confirmations
- Uploaded receipt required
- KYC incomplete
- Payout pending

📍 TRIP TIMELINE WIDGET:
Combine **Upcoming Trips** and **Past Trips** with a toggle or tabs:
- Card layout showing origin ➝ destination, dates, and match count
- Show status: Pending / In Progress / Completed

🆕 RECENT ACTIVITY STREAM:
Scrollable list showing latest events:
- Parcel delivered
- Funds released
- New review
- Trip confirmed
- Request received

🚫 REMOVE/REPLACE:
- Notifications widget (redundant with dropdown)
- Current graph (vague and non-actionable)
- Hardcoded Parcel Requests (irrelevant to some users)

📦 COMPONENT DESIGN:
Use Tailwind cards with subtle shadows and icons.
Maintain consistency in spacing (e.g., padding-6, rounded-xl).
All icons should be accessible and labeled with tooltips.
Responsive layout: collapses on mobile to accordion view.

📲 TOP-RIGHT DROPDOWN:
Move the following from sidebar to profile dropdown:
- Wallet
- Notifications
- Profile
- Referrals
- History

🧩 TECHNOLOGIES:
- React or Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Role-based rendering logic
- Reusable components and card containers
- Accessible navigation and responsive layout

🎨 STYLE NOTES:
- Clean, airy, and soft interface
- Use hover feedback and transition animations
- Consistent iconography and color language across cards
