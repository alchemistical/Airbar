✅ Prompt 1: Move “Send Package” to Sidebar
🔧 TASK: Modify the sidebar layout to include “Send Package” as a core navigation item.

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Improve navigation clarity by elevating "Send Package" to the primary sidebar menu. This reflects its importance in the sender’s journey.

📐 DESIGN GUIDELINES:
- Match the visual style and spacing of existing items (Dashboard, Trips, etc.)
- Use the icon: 🧳 or a package/box symbol in line with design consistency
- Sidebar order recommendation:
  1. Dashboard
  2. Trips
  3. Parcel Requests
  4. Send Package (⬅️ new item)
  5. Matches
  6. Tracking
  7. Earnings
  8. History
  9. Reviews
  10. Notifications
  11. Profile
  12. Referrals
  13. Support
  14. Logout

🧩 TECH:
- Ensure the sidebar routing leads to `/send-package`
- Active link highlight styling must apply when user is on that route
- Sidebar should remain responsive and consistent across all layouts

📂 FILES TO MODIFY:
- Sidebar component layout
- Sidebar menu data structure (if using an array-based sidebar config)
