🧠 PROJECT: Build the complete UI/UX for the “Wallet” section of Airbar’s dashboard

📍 ROUTE: `/dashboard/wallet` (replaces previous `/dashboard/earnings`)

🎯 GOAL:
Display earnings, transaction history, and withdrawal options for travelers who complete deliveries, while allowing senders to view reward payouts and referral bonuses.

🧭 USER FLOW OVERVIEW:

TRAVELER VIEW:
1. View current available balance ($)
2. See breakdown of pending vs. completed earnings
3. Transaction history: per trip, per parcel
4. Request payout (if KYC complete)
5. Link external wallet or payment method (PayPal, bank account, etc.)

SENDER VIEW:
1. View rewards paid
2. Referral bonuses
3. Payment method used for previous transactions

📦 COMPONENTS REQUIRED:

1. **Balance Summary Card (Top Section)**
   - Available Balance
   - Pending Rewards (parcel in-progress)
   - Withdrawable Balance
   - CTA: “Withdraw Funds”

2. **Transaction History Table**
   - Parcel/Trip ID
   - Description: [Parcel → City]
   - Amount Earned or Paid
   - Status (Pending, Completed, Failed)
   - Date
   - Filter by: Date, Status, Type (earning/payout/bonus)

3. **Withdraw Funds Modal/Form**
   - Confirm amount to withdraw
   - Choose payout method
   - KYC Verification badge (required to withdraw)
   - Confirmation & Processing time info

4. **Payout Setup Panel**
   - Add/Edit payout methods (bank, PayPal, stablecoin wallet)
   - Set default method
   - Show verification status for each

5. **Referral Bonus Panel (shared with Referrals section)**
   - Number of referrals completed
   - Earnings from referral
   - Referral program rules link

🧩 ROLE-BASED BEHAVIOUR:
- Travelers: See earnings & withdrawals
- Senders: See payment history & bonuses
- Admin-flag for incomplete KYC → lock payout button

🎨 DESIGN STANDARDS:
- Consistent with Airbar’s UI:
   • Light, flat panels
   • Monetary values clearly emphasized
   • Withdraw button styled distinctively
- Sidebar must be visible
- Mobile responsive (column stacks)
- UX hierarchy must show most useful balance information first

🧱 ESCROW INTEGRATION:
• Add a separate Escrow Balance card to top wallet summary
• Create a collapsible “Escrow Details” section under balance cards
• For each item:
   - Trip / Parcel ID
   - Locked amount
   - Status badge: Picked up / In transit / Awaiting confirmation
   - Delivery ETA
   - Escrow release condition: e.g., “Released after confirmation by sender”
• Show Escrow-to-Wallet flow visually (diagram or progress bar optional)

🧪 TEST CASES:
- User with 0 balance
- Multiple payout methods (one default)
- Withdrawing partially vs. fully
- Referral bonus earned but not yet available
- KYC incomplete state blocking withdrawal
