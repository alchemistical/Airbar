ðŸ§  Prompt for Replit AI: UI/UX Design for Airbar (Crowdshipping App)

You are a professional product designer working on a web-based peer-to-peer crowdshipping platform named Airbar. The platform connects parcel senders with travelers who have spare luggage space. You are tasked with building clean, modular, responsive UI/UX designs for each user journey using standard desktop web format (1440px width).

ðŸ§© GENERAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
	â€¢	Follow standard UI conventions for web apps (left navigation, header, main content area).
	â€¢	Use a 12-column grid system.
	â€¢	Use cards and modular components.
	â€¢	Left navigation should always be fully visible on desktop.
	â€¢	Each page must follow a consistent layout pattern.
	â€¢	Adhere to UX best practices: clarity, trust signals (KYC, ratings), minimalism, and step-by-step flows.
