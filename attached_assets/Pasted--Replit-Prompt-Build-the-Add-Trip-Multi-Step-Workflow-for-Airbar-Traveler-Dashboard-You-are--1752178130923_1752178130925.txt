🚀 Replit Prompt: Build the “Add Trip” Multi-Step Workflow for Airbar (Traveler Dashboard)
You are designing the Add Trip workflow for the traveler dashboard in Airbar — a peer-to-peer crowdshipping platform. Travelers use this feature to submit their travel plans and offer luggage space for carrying parcels. This is a multi-step, navigational form optimized for desktop web (1440px wide).

🎯 Page to Build
Route: /dashboard/traveler/trips/addtrip
Form Type: Multi-step wizard with top progress tracker and “Next / Back” navigation.
Target Users: Verified travelers with spare luggage capacity.

🧠 UX & UI Guidelines
Use a 5-step progress tracker at the top with completed state indicators.


Use modular cards for each step section.


Validate each step independently before proceeding.


Include tooltips, field hints, and placeholder values for clarity.


Maintain full visibility of the left navigation bar (sidebar).


Prevent any content cropping. Full-screen desktop format.


Auto-save draft after each step (if applicable in backend).


Final step shows a review page with editable cards before submission.
